The point of this excercise is to ask a user for a string, seperate string values and place them into an array, then convert the string values into integers (granted the user gives us numbers in the string).
Then perform some basic math functions with the array. <br> <br>
<script type="text/javascript">


//Create a string variable that prompts the user for 5 numbers seperated by commas
	var str = prompt("Enter 5 numbers delimited by commas (example: 1,2,3,4,5)\nDo not put spaces between them.");

//Create an array variable to pass our user inputs to
	var strArray = new Array();

//Split function can seperate user inputs by targeting whatever is in quotes.
//Pass the split string inputs to the array.
	strArray = str.split(",");


//Test to see if the inputs were passed to the array. 
//Join the inputs with a space to show that the commas were removed by split function.
	console.log("User inputs still in string type: "+ strArray.join(" "));
	document.write("User inputs in string type: "+ strArray.join("  ") + "<br>");


//Convert string values to number/integer values with the map(Number) function. 
	var numArray = strArray.map(Number);


	console.log("This is the numArray we parsed from the string type array " +numArray.join(" "));
	document.write("User inputs in integer type: " +numArray.join(" ") + "<br>");

//Use native Math functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the 
	var maxNum = Math.max.apply(null, strArray);
	var minNum = Math.min.apply(null, strArray);
//Display the maxium and minimum values

	console.log("This is the max: " + maxNum + " This is the min: " + minNum);
	document.write("This is the max: " + maxNum + "<br>" + "This is the min:  " + minNum);
